## Brief description of the project
Within the context of the [Data Mining and Machine Learning](https://hecnet.unil.ch/hec/syllabus/descriptif/2457?dyn_lang=fr) course given by Prof. [Michalis Vlachos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalis-vlachos/) we have realized this project. It is about predicting the difficulty level of a sentence (A1-C2) using machine learning techniques. To carry out this task we have at our disposal a dataset of 5000 entries which contains annotated sentences to train our models. A competition related to this project is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detecting-french-texts-difficulty-level-2022/overview).
