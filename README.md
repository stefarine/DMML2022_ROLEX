## Brief description of the project
Within the context of the [Data Mining and Machine Learning](https://hecnet.unil.ch/hec/syllabus/descriptif/2457?dyn_lang=fr) course given by Prof. [Michalis Vlachos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalis-vlachos/) we have realized this project. It is about predicting the difficulty level of a sentence (A1-C2) using machine learning techniques. To carry out this task we have at our disposal a dataset of 5000 entries which contains annotated sentences to train our models. A competition related to this project is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detecting-french-texts-difficulty-level-2022/overview).

My name is Stéphane I am 26 years old and I come from Geneva. I am curious by nature and I love to learn new things. I really enjoy working in teams on IT related topics and find solutions to problems. I love programming and in particular implementing Android applications.

## Approach
To carry out this project, we have an annotated dataset where each record corresponds to a sentence and the indication of its level. At first, we worked on these data without using any data cleaning technique. We vectorized the sentences using TFIDF and tried with the following basic techniques: Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree, Random Forests.
